# react-native-chnirt-ui

UI Chnirt is a React Native UI Library that allows you creating stunning multi-brand cross-platform mobile applications. The library is based on Eva Design System which brings consistency and scalability in the design and development process. It contains a set of general purpose UI components styled in a similar way. And the most awesome thing: the themes can be changed in the runtime, with no need to reload the application.
